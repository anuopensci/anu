# anubrand R package

**This is work-in-progress!**

The `anubrand` package is a collection of functions to help quickly get ANU related information and assets.

The current useful part of the package is that you can get the logo quickly using `logo_get()`.


You can get the ANU color palette as

```{r}
anubrand::color_palette()
```
