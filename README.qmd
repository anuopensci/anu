# ANU R package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

**This is work-in-progress!**

The `anu` package is a collection of functions to help quickly get ANU related information and assets.

The current useful part of the package is that you can get the logo quickly using `logo_get()`.


You can get the ANU color palette as

```{r}
anu::color_palette()
```
