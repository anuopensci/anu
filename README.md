# ANU R package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

**This is work-in-progress!**

The `anu` package is a collection of functions to help quickly get ANU
related information and assets.

The current useful part of the package is that you can get the logo
quickly using `logo_get()`.

You can get the ANU color palette as

``` r
anu::color_palette()
#> gold_tint     black     white      gold 
#> "#F5EDDE" "#000000" "#FFFFFF" "#BE830E"
```
